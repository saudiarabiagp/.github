While Piastri comes off a recent victory at the Bahrain Grand Prix, reigning champion Max Verstappen faces struggles, placing sixth and trailing closely in the championship points. Notably, Verstappen's early-season woes contrast starkly with his past dominance in this race. Fans can watch the race live on ESPN or stream it with Fubo, which offers a free trial. Start times vary across North America, making it accessible for a wide audience.

It's a sharp contrast from a year ago, when Verstappen dominated in Jeddah with teammate Sergio Perez following him home for a Red Bull one-two. Fast forward to 2025, and the Dutchman finds himself in a much tougher spot, grappling with the limitations of the RB21.

Still, the four-time world champion has used all of his experience to keep himself firmly in the title picture, limiting the damage during Red Bull's turbulent spell.
